[GOAL] 

This package is a conceptual scaffolding for a larger, more ML based project that I will be building and maintaining hereafter. 

This package will help those who work with text files process them more easily, in intuitive and useful ways.

Methods provided in this package will allow for one shot analysis of entire folders of text files.

This package incorporates sentiment analysis; ultimately it will also allow a user to determined how long it will take either themselves or a particular person to read a given text after that individual's reading rate has been calculated.

Use cases: 

Aid researchers in batch-processing a corpus. 

Aid teachers in quantifying the growth of their student's writing abilities.
